        "This plant is native to warm regions and is, therefore, is very sensitive to low temperatures. The winter minimum is around 12°C for a short time and slightly lower, and the summer maximum is  29°C. It tolerates the standard humidity of living spaces well, but it will feel better and grow more luxuriantly if there is more moisture. The ideal humidity of the room in which it is located should be around 40%. Misting the leaves will help to raise the humidity.",

        "Water your {{title}} when the top 75% of the soil is dry. Water until liquid flows through the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot. Be sure to empty any excess water that collects in the saucer. Yellow leaves may indicate over watering, while brown leaves mean the plant needs more water.",

        "{{title}} likes to stay pretty moist, at least during growing season. We've personally noticed faster growth with regular waterings and not leaving it too dry for too long. That said, this plant won't pout if you forget to water it now and then, and is more sensitive to overwatering if anything. I typically water when the potting medium is dried down 1-2\" and I don't let the root ball dry out. In the winter, you can cut down watering. "

    "soil": [
        "The jungle-like beauty is not picky about soil and will do quite well in a  standard substrate for houseplants. The most important is that the substrate is well-drained. Therefore, apply a drainage layer of clay balls or tile fragments at the bottom of the pot.",
        "Well-draining, organic-rich loamy soil is a good base for this plant. Add a little peat moss or some orchid bark to provide extra drainage while still holding some moisture. Perlite can also improve drainage. Avoid soils that become waterlogged or that are excessively sandy. A pH level of 6.0-6.5 should be fine for your plants.",
        "A free-draining organic potting mix which allows breathability for the roots is ideal, and this houseplant also grows extremely well in coco chips or orchid bark."

        "{{title}} propagation is surprisingly easy. Select healthy cuttings that have at least a few leaf nodes on them. Set your cuttings into a glass of water or into moistened potting soil. Make sure that the lowest leaf node is under the surface. Roots will form from that point.",
        "There are two options here. You can place the cuttings in water to root for a few weeks or put directly into coco chips (for lots of aeration). If in water, wait until the roots are a few centimetres long before potting on. If you pot directly into coco chips, be sure to water regularly."
